Benchmarking Data Flow Systems for Scalable Machine Learning.

This is the code associated with the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3070612) presented at the [BeyondMR Workshop @ SIGMOD 2017](https://sites.google.com/site/beyondmr2017/). We use the [PEEL framework](http://peel-framework.org/) to define and execute the benchmark experiments.

Experiments Definitions and Code for the supervised learning experiments will be added soon.
